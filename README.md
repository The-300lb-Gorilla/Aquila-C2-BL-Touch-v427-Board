# Aquila C2 (Ender 3 Pro Clone)with a BL-Touch on an upgraded v427-Board. The OEM main board has been replaced, as well as the case for the mainboard. 
A working BL Touch Firmware Package for the Voxelab Aquila C2 (9 or 16 Probing Points) with a v427 Mainboard. There are STL files available to mount the BL Touch on a Aquila C2. There is also a really strong BL Touch Armor Cover for it as well. I did NOT design these two models, the attribution files are in PDF format and show the original models and who designed them.
